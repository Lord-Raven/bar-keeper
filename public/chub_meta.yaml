This is little more than a proof of concept for the kind of experiences that Chub's stages can produce. 
<br>
<br>
Adding this stage to a chat will essentially convert that session into a simple bartending visual novel, 
where the user's persona is a bartender who meets and interacts with various characters, but the only choices the player makes is what drinks to serve when prompted. 
<br>
<br>
The stage will distill the chat's primary character card into a set of themes and use that to generate a bar, five beverages, and four characters based on the chat's primary character card--
plus an additional character for each bot you add to the chat. Characters will come and go, with a handful of drink prompts each night and a limited stock of each beverage. 
Storylines and relationships may emerge and resolve organically, hopefully influenced by the drinks you choose to give. There's no end game, just a stream of nights and regulars.
<br>
<br>
**Warning**
_This stage makes *many* generative calls, especially up front. These requests should honor the user's jailbreak, but they will include additional instructions and details that are often the result of other text gen requests._ 
<br>
<br>
The stage isn't particularly NSFW in itself, but it does contain some NSFW sample data; the game will derive themes from the character card, which could result in unsavory extrapolations---some of which may not be immediately transparent to the player.
<br>
<br>
Chub will block image generation of questionable content, which could be triggered by the procedural nature of this stage's content generation--especially if the character you are using features immature themes. 
If you are seeing lots of missing images, please consider playing this stage with a different card.
<br>
<br>
\"New Game\" will always blow away all of the stage's content for that chat, so unless you are unhappy with what was generated the first time around and want a completely fresh start, I would suggest starting an entirely new chat. 
If you dislike a particular piece of art that was generated, you can use the settings pane to regenerate specific drink and patron images.
<br>
<br>
**Shortcomings**
I feel there are some clear shortfalls in what this stage achieves, and maybe some of these items could be addressed with sufficient time or motivation, but I don't know that they will be.
<li>
* It probably looks terrible in some layouts--especially portrait.
* There is an issue where stage-originated textgen requests can repeatedly fail. In my experience, refreshing a few times or clearing the cache can resolve this. If the stage stops loading new responses, this is likely the culprit.
* A lot of the stage's behavior and performance is contingent upon your personal generation settings; your jailbreak in particular could cause trouble if it is overpowering the stage's instructions.
* The stage does very little quality control, so you are at the mercy of the LLM to properly format responses and not go off the rails with activity that isn't internally represented by the stage.
</li>
<br>
<br>
**What's Next**
For me, this was an exercise in producing a stage that exists outside of the traditional chat structure, demonstrating that stages can offer completely different experiences. 
Although it may feel like a (linear) chat, this stage doesn't leverage Chub's chat tree whatsoever (you can see this by the stagnant message counts while playing). 
I have no further significant plans for this stage, but I may continue to tweak and improve it over time. 
I am already applying a lot of what I've learned here toward more elaborate projects, so hopefully I'll have some cool stuff to share in the future =).
